Hi Team I will explain what is this progaram about in the below lines:

a. Model name I have chosen as UserPortal
b. Covered most of the actions or methods like create, index, edit, show and destroy
c. Complete validation done with some unique feature
d. table created with index to make sure during filter it is fast
e. Dropdown added as filter with the data type as enum
f. Pagination done for both index and show methods of size 20 (per page)
g. Followed ruby standard syntax and code (checked with rubocop)
h. Filter added
i. In routes added admin as a namespace for the better reading the url
j. Couldn't cover the bootstrap design but used the basic form tag

Note:
This program I mostly focused on the backend part.
I was facing issue in uploading these files in github as my visual code is connected to gitlab so it took some extra time to connect.
